## Troubleshooting

### If the link doesn't work:
- Make sure you're logged into the correct Fitbit account
- Ensure your Versa 2 is connected and synced
- Try disconnecting Developer Bridge if you have it active
- Check that the link hasn't expired or been revoked

### If installation fails:
- Restart your Versa 2
- Restart the Fitbit app on your phone
- Ensure your Versa 2 firmware is up to date
- Try syncing your device first, then install

### Developer Bridge Conflict:
If you're actively developing and have Developer Bridge connected:
- Disconnect Developer Bridge in the Fitbit CLI
- Close the Fitbit CLI
- Then try installing from the private link
- You can reconnect Developer Bridge after installation

## Notes

- The private link allows installation without the watchface being publicly listed
- Only people with the link can install it
- You can share this link with testers, friends, or family
- The watchface will appear in your Clock Faces list like any other installed watchface
